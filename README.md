React native exercise about consume the TMDB API

This time I'm gonna make a faster (I hope) exercise with the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en), which allow us to consume all the movie library in their database.

![Initial tools](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8mSCdyuID9js2vso-P4GY82eu-daA6lU2QdVZR-ZGOePg39m-pUZWH2ed74MNR8-stYRverjnlmr=s800)

First of all, I need the main idea for the app, so, I drew an scratch on my notebook with my color pens.

As a result, now I know (with a high probability) what's I'm going to do.

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nO6mnnn-9n62yxEIH1Yw40t8gZbWHOylD613wQK660B4C1v9_NYQXxhF2AgD_1xKF-ImIWMuU8fK=s1000)

Yes, is rustic, archaic maybe, but enough for my main purpose.

From the last image I can recognize the next elements:

 - Splash screen
 - Main screen
 - Basic movie screen
 - Extended movie screen

That's all, now, I would like to write some features for every screen, ir order to get more detail before start to write code.

**Splash screen**

Just an icon in the middle of the screen. Obviously, right now I'm thinking about what kind of animation I will do, but, I in this moment a prefer thinking in a basic non-animated version to think in a hundred of possibilities.

**Main screen**

This screen has access to the three categories for this example: Popular, Top rated, and Upcoming.

From here, the user can access to search a movie, and back to the main screen. I drew a link to profile, but, to be honest, I don't think I'll have time enough to do that, so, I'll remove it.

The user will see an horizontal scroll with the movies in this category as well. Every movie section has the official poster about the movie that it represent.

**Basic movie screen**

Basically, here I'll show the basics about the movie:

 - Poster
 - Ranking value
 - Title
 - Original title
 - Genres
 - Short description
 - Favorite button
 - Play trailer button
 - Extends data button

**Extended movie screen**

Similar to the last screen, but, here we can find:

 - Title
 - Release year
 - Stars ranking
 - Numeric ranking
 - Total votes
 - Complete description
 - Back button
 - Share button

I think that I'll make some changes, but I'll try to keep this structure. Also, from the beginning, I need to code thinking about the Animated API, in order to achieve them easier in the future.

Next step is to structure the application (in order to have clear how do I need to create my folders), but, I'm haven't time to make a nice digital graphic, so, I'll write it right here:

 - Main app (App.js)
	 - Components
	- Assets
	- Screens
	- Providers

*Components*

This folder is going to have some little components for almost every part in the app. I'll try to encapsulate as many as I can.

*Assets*

Fonts, images, etc.

*Screens*

This is the place to keep the main interfaces, such as Splash, Main scree, Movie screens, etc.

*Providers*

This folder is going to have controllers in order to manage the internal database, http connections, and business logic.
